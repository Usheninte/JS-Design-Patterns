# Problem

JavaScript is not very strict when it comes to encapsulation and each script tends to pollute the global namespace. This is because the language has been built with global variables in mind.

# Solution

The Module pattern is a great solution to encapsulate some code. The idea is to store in a variable the returned expression of an IIFE (Immediately-Invoked Function Expression), which can be for instance another function declared inside the module. Within the IIFE, the scope is private. We can then declare private variables and functions that will be invisible from the outside. Conceptually, a module is a bit like a class. 

N.B. In practice, this pattern is not often used anymore. CommonJS, AMD, or built-in ES6 modules are much better solutions nowadays...
