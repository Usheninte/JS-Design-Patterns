# This repo is for educational purposes

I took a course on **Practical Design Patterns in JavaScript**, and decided to do some further reading.

The 2 inner repositories, are from these sources:
* [An ultra-simplified explanation of design patterns implemented in javascript](https://github.com/sohamkamani/javascript-design-patterns-for-humans)  
* [ES5 + ES6 + CoffeeScript + TypeScript design patterns with some theory, real-world examples and UML diagrams](https://github.com/Badacadabra/JavaScript-Design-Patterns)
